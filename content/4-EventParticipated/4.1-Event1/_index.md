- Modernization is the process of progressively transforming applications to achieve the availability, scalability, business agility, and cost optimization benefits of running on the cloud.

***Top 4 Use cases – App Modernization with GenAI.***

**Use case 1: Streamline VMware Migration with AWS Transform for VMware**

*Accelerate infrastructure migration and modernization with intelligent discovery and automated execution*

- Slash VMware migration timelines with AWS Transform's intelligent automation.

- Convert complex network configurations in hours instead of weeks using Al-powered discovery, dependency mapping, and automated wave planning.

- Scale your migration practice with automated security group creation, intelligent EC2 instance selection, and flexible deployment options including hub-and-spoke or isolated
VPC configurations.

- Gain up to 90% improverent in execution times while reducing manual effort by 80%.

**Use case 2: GenAI Development with AWS Serverless and Container Solutions**

*Build Enterprise-Ready GenAI Applications Across AWS Serverless and Containers Platforms*

- AWS offers two powerful paths for GenAI application development and deployment:

  + Serverless with AWS Bedrock: Rapidly develop and deploy GenAI applications using AWS Lambda, ECS with Fargate, Step Functions, and EventBridge. Ideal for chatbots, document generation, and intelligent content processing. Leverage the latest AWS Bedrock updates and reference architectures.

  + Container-Based with Amazon EKS: Build, train, and run GenAl apps on Kubernetes, benefiting from its powerful orchestration capabilities. Utilize open-source tools and cloud-native services for scalable GenAl workloads. Flexible deployment across cloud and on-premises environments with constant innovation from the OSS community.

- Choose one approach or combine both to best fit your specific GenAI application requirements and accelerate your AI journey.

**Use case 3: Revolutionize .NET Modernization with AWS Transform for .NET**

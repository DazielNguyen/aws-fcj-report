### [Blog 1 - Redirecting Internet-bound traffic through a transparent forward proxy](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog explains how to implement a transparent forward proxy solution for centralized internet egress traffic inspection on AWS. You will learn why transparent proxies are important for organizations that need to inspect all outbound traffic without configuring explicit proxy settings on each client device, how to use Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP) to redirect traffic seamlessly through proxy servers, and how to integrate this solution with AWS Transit Gateway, AWS Network Firewall, and third-party virtual appliances. The article walks you through the architecture design, routing configuration, packet flow analysis, and provides real-world use cases for secure internet access, data loss prevention, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### [Blog 2 - Building resilient multi-Region Serverless applications on AWS](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog explains how to build resilient multi-Region serverless applications on AWS to ensure high availability for mission-critical services. You will learn why multi-Region architectures are essential for applications that cannot tolerate regional disruptions (such as authentication systems, payment processors, and real-time gaming features), how to choose between Active-Passive and Active-Active deployment patterns based on your recovery time objectives and budget constraints, and how AWS serverless services with pay-for-value pricing make multi-Region deployments more cost-effective than traditional approaches. The article walks you through implementing a multi-Region serverless authorizer using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon Route 53, and DynamoDB Global Tables, while covering best practices for failover strategies, health monitoring, observability, and chaos engineering testing.

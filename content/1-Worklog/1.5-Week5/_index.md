### Week 5 Objectives:

- Learn foundational knowledge and core security services on AWS, centered around the "Security is job zero" philosophy.
- Start with the most basic concept: the **Shared Responsibility Model**.
- Focus deeply on managing identity and access (**Identity and Access Management - IAM**), including components: **User**, **Group**, **Policy**, and **Role**.
- Expand learning to identity management services at a larger scale, such as **AWS Organizations** (managing multiple accounts), **AWS Identity Center (SSO)** (single sign-on), and **Amazon Cognito** (user management for web/mobile apps).
- Gain solid knowledge of data protection through encryption with **AWS KMS** and monitoring/compliance checks with **AWS Security Hub**.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day 	| Task 	| Start Date 	| Completion Date 	| Reference Material 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 2 	| **Shared Responsibility Model**<br><br>- Learn about the **Shared Responsibility Model**, in which AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud (physical infrastructure, underlying software) and the customer is responsible for security *in* the cloud (configuration, data, applications).<br>- Understand how security responsibilities change depending on the service type (infrastructure, combined management, or fully managed).<br><br>**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**<br><br>- Learn about the **Root Account**, the account with absolute full permissions, and best practices to protect it (create an IAM Admin User for regular use, lock away root credentials).<br>- Learn about **IAM User**, a principal used to interact with AWS, which has no permissions by default when created.<br>- Understand the technique for efficient user management by grouping multiple IAM Users into an **IAM Group**.<br>- Learn about **IAM Policy**, a JSON document that defines permissions, including 2 types:<br>+ **Identity-based Policy**: Attached directly to an IAM Principal (User, Group, Role).<br>+ **Resource-based Policy**: Attached directly to a resource (e.g., S3 Bucket Policy).<br>- Understand the IAM permission evaluation technique, where an **explicit deny** always takes precedence, regardless of any other Allow policy.<br>- Learn about the architecture of **IAM Role**, a set of permissions (policy) without permanent credentials (password/access key).<br>- Understand the **Assume Role** technique: An IAM User (or Service) uses the **AWS STS (Security Token Service)** to temporarily "assume" the IAM Role's permissions and receive temporary credentials.<br>- Understand the practical application of IAM Role, e.g., granting an **EC2** service permission to access S3 without storing access keys on the server. 	| 06/10/2025 	| 06/10/2025 	| **Documentation:** https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/<br>**Youtube:** https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahN4TLWtox2a3vElknwzU_urND8hLn1i&si=W80Cdf_fSc6sjOV<br>**Notes:** https://github.com/DazielNguyen/aws-fcj-report/blob/main/TAKE_NOTES_%26_LABS/Module_05/Take_notes_module_05.md 	|
| 3 	| <br>**Amazon Cognito**<br><br>- Learn about **Amazon Cognito**, a service for managing authentication (login, sign-up) and authorization for *end-users* of web and mobile applications (different from IAM Users, who are AWS administrators).<br>- Learn about the two main components of Cognito:<br>+ **User Pool**: A user directory that manages users, supporting direct login or login via third-party providers (Facebook, Google).<br>+ **Identity Pool**: Grants application users access (usually temporary) to other AWS services.<br><br>**AWS Organizations**<br><br>- Learn about **AWS Organizations**, a service that helps centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts.<br>- Understand the **Consolidated Billing** technique for all accounts.<br>- Understand the technique of grouping accounts into **OUs (Organization Units)** and applying **Service Control Policies (SCP)** to *limit* the maximum permissions that IAM Users/Roles in that account can perform (including deny-based).<br><br>**AWS Identity Center (SSO)**<br><br>- Learn about **AWS Identity Center (SSO)**, a service that helps centrally manage access (single sign-on) to all AWS accounts in an Organization and to external applications.<br>- Understand the technique of using **Permission Sets** (a set of permissions stored in Identity Center) to assign to Users/Groups. When a user accesses an account, the Permission Set is granted as an IAM Role within that account. 	| 07/10/2025 	| 07/10/2025 	| **Documentation:** https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/<br>**Youtube:** https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahN4TLWtox2a3vElknwzU_urND8hLn1i&si=W80Cdf_fSc6sjOV<br>**Notes:** https://github.com/DazielNguyen/aws-fcj-report/blob/main/TAKE_NOTES_%26_LABS/Module_05/Take_notes_module_05.md 	|

### Week 5 Achievements:

- **Foundational Lesson:** Master the **Shared Responsibility Model**, clearly understanding AWS's responsibilities versus the customer's.
- **IAM Service (Core):**
  + Clearly distinguish between the **Root Account** (full permissions, needs to be locked away) and **IAM User** (used daily, no permissions by default).
  + Master the 3 main components for granting permissions: **IAM User** (the entity), **IAM Policy** (the permission - written in JSON), and **IAM Group** (a group of entities).
  + Clearly understand **IAM Role**: a mechanism to grant temporary permissions (no permanent credentials) to both Users and Services (like EC2).
- **IAM Techniques (Important):**
  + Know how a User/Service "receives" a Role's permissions through the **Assume Role** technique (using the **STS** service).
  + Understand the permission evaluation rule: An **Explicit Deny** always overrides any Allow permissions.
- **Identity Management Services (Identity Services):**
  + Clearly differentiate between **IAM** (manages AWS administrators) and **Amazon Cognito** (manages end-users of web/mobile apps).
  + Know that **Cognito User Pool** is the user directory (can log in with Facebook, Google) and **Identity Pool** is what grants those users access to AWS resources.
- **Multi-Account Management Service (Multi-Account):**
  + Understand **AWS Organizations** is used for centrally managing multiple accounts, enabling **Consolidated Billing**.
  + Know how to use **Service Control Policies (SCP)** within an Organization to *limit* the maximum permissions of member accounts.
  + Understand **AWS Identity Center (SSO)** as the single sign-on solution, using **Permission Sets** to grant access to accounts within the Organization.
- **Encryption Service (Encryption):**
  + Know **AWS KMS** is the service for creating and managing encryption keys.
  + Understand the **Encryption at Rest** mechanism and differentiate between **CMK** (the master key in KMS) and **Data Key** (the key used to encrypt the actual data).
- **Security Monitoring Service (Monitoring):**
  + Know **AWS Security Hub** is the service that scans and provides security scores, helping to check compliance against standards (like **PCIDSS**).
- **Hands-on:**
  + Practice creating and managing Users, Groups, Policies, and Roles.
  + Practice implementing SSO and KMS.
  + Practice using advanced IAM features like **Conditions** and **Permission Boundaries**.

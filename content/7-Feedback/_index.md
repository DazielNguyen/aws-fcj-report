### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is professional, with FCJ community members being very friendly and open. Especially, senior FCJ members as well as peers in my cohort are always ready to support and answer questions when my team and I face difficulties in designing and using AWS services.

However, I think next time, if possible, there should be a fixed schedule for team members to come to the office more easily instead of competing as currently, so that everyone in the team can more easily access and communicate directly, as some members didn't have time to get acquainted outside initially and could only get to know each other online.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentors are extremely dedicated and caring, along with a very large number of supporting FCJers. Initially, I was a bit hesitant about whether I could improve the knowledge I learned at school and apply it to work, and was somewhat confused when starting to learn and work. But I saw the opportunity in it from friends and seniors who are also developing new opportunities and new challenges. I am very grateful for the enthusiastic support from Nghi Danh who answered some of my questions about applying AI to Cloud, and I also thank mentors like Brother Kha and Master Hung, as well as previous season FCJers who enthusiastically supported and helped me.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The work I perform and learn will help me solve bigger problems, not just solving problems for a small school project, and instead I learned how to handle large projects, from attending events, not only expanding knowledge, but with my curiosity, I also explored many new technologies and researched how to apply them in practice. With my major being an AI Developer, I also need to develop further and learn more deeply about AWS ML/AI services.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills not only about my major but also other soft skills. I worked with new people, with people not in the same major, thereby gaining different perspectives from each field as well as skills through sharing among team members. I attended many meaningful events from experienced seniors at large corporations, learned how they apply AI to work as well as other advanced programming skills that helped me better orient my career. It also opened up the opportunity for me to become a Cloud Engineer in the future alongside my AI Developer work.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive. Everyone in the company provides dedicated support with a spirit focused on learning and sharing knowledge. During work, everyone works extremely focused but also has very enjoyable moments. When deadlines approach, everyone works together and supports each other regardless of position - whoever finishes their work supports those who haven't finished, those who know help those who don't, as long as there's a problem, everyone will support to solve it quickly and effectively. This helped me easily integrate with everyone even though I'm just an intern.

### Additional Questions

> What did you find **most satisfying** during your internship?

- I think what I was most satisfied with during the internship was attending Workshops and Events. Initially, I was quite confused when participating in large-scale events for developers for the first time. Participating was not enough, but I also got hands-on experience and learned a tremendous amount of knowledge about programming skills and applying AI to programming. This helped me significantly reduce the time spent when starting any new project, instead helping me save time and learn more knowledge.

> What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?

- I think you should improve the Rules for replying to messages for new members, and how they can grasp information when seniors assign a new task. I propose a solution that when sending messages, you should require members to reply to that message by responding with something like 'copied', so that important messages are not lost and members who read messages later can catch up. Everything else I see is extremely good and meticulous.

> If recommending to a friend, would you **suggest they intern here**? Why or why not?

- Of course, I extremely recommend friends to intern here, because this is the closest gateway for them to access real work, about what businesses are using and applying today, helping them find more opportunities right before their eyes. Here, you not only access new knowledge but also see how large enterprises solve their company's problems, and they can reflect on themselves and develop more during the internship.

### Suggestions & Expectations

> Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?

- I have no suggestions to further improve the internship experience, because the program has already provided fully and too many new things for an intern experiencing at an enterprise.

> Would you like to continue this program in the future?

- Definitely, I will pursue and continue this program in the future. I need to learn more and accomplish much more.

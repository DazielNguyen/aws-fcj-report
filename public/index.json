They also adhered to current regulations and laws in management and did not collect user information. Once on AWS, the most important factor is the ability to scale rapidly, which leads to substantial gains when moving to the AWS environment. Applying AI is proving highly effective in their businesses—for example, anh Vinh has applied AI to detect potentially fraudulent transactions and defend against hackers in Blockchain. 6. Understand AWS security best practices from development to production environments What I Learned 5-step framework: Align → Assess → Mobilize → Modernize → Reinvent. GenAI-assisted modernization: code transformation (Java 8→21, .NET→8), dependency mapping, environment assessment. Prioritize high-impact workloads, human-in-the-loop, measure ROI. Design Thinking Problem→Pilot→Scale; prioritize value-first. Strangler Fig refactor by parts; event-driven mindset. Platform thinking/IDP, security-by-design, early governance. Technical Architecture Microservices, containers (EKS/ECS/Fargate), serverless (Lambda/Step Functions/EventBridge). Data: Aurora MySQL, MSK (Kafka), ElastiCache (Redis). VMware→AWS: rehost EC2 → replatform containers/managed → refactor app. Multi-arch (x86_64 + ARM64), end-to-end observability. Modernization Strategies Assess/Mobilize/MM/Reinvent (Techcombank blueprint). AWS Transform: for VMware \u0026amp; .NET (automated migration/testing/UI modernization). Cost-first: drop Windows/SQL licenses, right-size, ARM64. Scale \u0026amp; Innovate: decompose monolith, CI/CD automation, adopt GenAI. Application to Work Build a migration backlog by ROI; select a small pilot. Standardize container baseline (EKS) + Bedrock pattern for GenAI. Use Amazon Q/Transform to upgrade languages \u0026amp; refactor quickly. Design an internal IDP: service templates, golden paths, policy guardrails. Experience at the event “GenAI-powered Migration \u0026amp; Modernization provided a comprehensive view of transforming applications \u0026amp; databases at enterprise scale. Highlights: demos of automated VMware/.NET migration, serverless–container reference architectures, quantitative ROI lessons and battle-tested governance models, along with case studies that significantly shortened migration time and reduced costs.”\nLearning from highly specialized speakers Techcombank: operate with CCoE, measure business outcomes, 5-step roadmap.

	"content": "VPC endpoints VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

Clearly differentiate between a Public Subnet (with an Internet Gateway) and a Private Subnet (using a NAT Gateway for Internet access). Compare and contrast the two main firewall mechanisms: Security Group (stateful, applies to ENI) and NACL (stateless, applies to Subnet). Present how to privately connect from a VPC to AWS services (like S3) without going over the Internet using a VPC Endpoint. Evaluate the pros and cons of two VPC connection solutions: VPC Peering (1:1 connection, no transitive support) and Transit Gateway (hub-and-spoke model, simplifies management). Describe methods for establishing a hybrid cloud connection, including Site-to-Site VPN (over the Internet) and AWS Direct Connect (private physical connection). Classify and select the appropriate Elastic Load Balancer type for specific scenarios: Application Load Balancer (ALB): For HTTP/HTTPS traffic (Layer 7), supports path-based routing. Network Load Balancer (NLB): For TCP/TLS traffic (Layer 4), requires ultra-high performance and static IP. Gateway Load Balancer (GLB): Used for integrating virtual appliances.

	"content": "Personal Finance Management App 1. Executive Summary The Personal Finance Management App project aims to provide an intelligent, modern, and highly automated personal financial management platform. The application allows users to record income and expenses, create and manage multiple money jars for different purposes, create spending plans, receive smart alerts, and generate visual analytical reports.\nThe application is built with a microservices architecture on .NET and FastAPI platform, deployed on AWS Cloud, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and data security. The development process follows the Agile/Scrum model (2 weeks/sprint), with MVP completion time within 2 months.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current weather stations require manual data collection, becoming unmanageable with multiple units. There is no centralized system for real-time data or analytics, and third-party platforms are costly and overly complex.\nSolution\nThe solution uses AWS Cloud combined with microservices architecture to build an automated personal financial management platform, integrating AI in voice processing and bill recognition. The system is deployed on AWS ECS Fargate for backend services (.NET), FastAPI for AI processing, and Next.js for frontend. Compared to popular financial platforms like Money Lover or Misa Money Keeper, this application focuses on complete automation of financial data entry through detailed Vietnamese AI voice-to-text and bill scanning, helping reduce manual operations and errors. The system is suitable for individual users and small groups, and can be expanded when needed for enterprise scale or digital banking applications.\nBenefits and Return on Investment (ROI)\nThe solution brings many practical benefits both technically and in business value:\nData Entry Automation: Reduces over 70% manual operations through AI voice and bill recognition. Increased Accuracy: Limits input errors, ensures financial data integrity (\u0026gt;90% accuracy). Improved User Performance: Record and categorize transactions in just seconds, optimizing user experience. Cost Savings: Low infrastructure costs thanks to AWS Free Tier utilization until 2026; only estimated ~$60 USD/month for AWS and ~$30 USD for AI compute. Fast ROI: Expected payback in 6–12 months, thanks to time savings in data entry and increased operational efficiency. Scalability \u0026amp; Integration: Microservices architecture on AWS allows easy addition of features (mobile app, advanced analytics, banking integration). 3. Solution Architecture The system is built on a microservices architecture hosted on AWS Cloud, combining serverless components, containerized services, and managed databases for scalability and performance.\nUsers access the Next.js web application through Amazon CloudFront, with static content hosted in Amazon S3 and routed via Amazon Route 53. The first layer of security is provided by AWS WAF, which protects the system from common web attacks such as SQL injection and XSS.\nWhen users log in, authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito, which issues access tokens used by the frontend to call APIs through Amazon API Gateway. The API Gateway routes requests to an Application Load Balancer (ALB) via AWS PrivateLink, and the ALB forwards them to Amazon ECS (Fargate) — where the backend containers are deployed, including:\nBackend Service: Handles the core business logic of the system. AI Service (FastAPI): Handles invoice processing, voice recognition, and other AI tasks. The AI Service can access files from Amazon S3 for data processing, then return the results to the Backend Service through internal APIs.\nContainer images are stored in Amazon ECR, and the deployment process is fully automated using GitLab CI/CD pipelines — including build, push to ECR, and ECS task definition updates.\nAll logs, metrics, and alerts from ECS, API Gateway, and ALB are collected in Amazon CloudWatch for centralized monitoring, while Amazon SNS is configured to send automatic notifications when incidents occur.\nAWS Services Used\nAmazon Route 53: Domain name and DNS management. AWS WAF: Protects the system from common web attacks. Amazon CloudFront: Global content delivery and frontend acceleration. Amazon S3: Stores static website content and user files (invoices, audio files). Amazon Cognito: User authentication and access management. Amazon API Gateway: Entry point for frontend requests, routing traffic to backend services. AWS PrivateLink: Provides secure, private connectivity between API Gateway and ALB within the VPC. Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes traffic across backend containers on ECS. Amazon ECS (Fargate): Runs containerized backend and FastAPI (AI) services. Amazon ECR: Container image registry for ECS deployment. Amazon CloudWatch: Centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting. Amazon SNS: Sends alerts and notifications during incidents. GitLab CI/CD: Automates the container build, push, and deploy pipeline to ECS. 4. Technical Deployment Implementation Phases\nResearch and Architecture Design: Study microservices models and design the overall architecture on AWS (including CloudFront, ECS Fargate, RDS, S3, API Gateway, Cognito) — (Month 1 - 2). Cost Estimation and Optimization: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate cost and optimize service selection for affordability and ease of deployment — (Month 2 - 3). Development, Testing, and Deployment: Build frontend (Next.js), backend (.NET), and AI service (FastAPI); perform microservice integration testing; deploy the system to AWS via ECS Fargate; and set up monitoring with CloudWatch — (Month 3 - 4). Technical Requirements\nFrontend: The Next.js web application is hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via CloudFront, communicating securely with the backend through API Gateway. User authentication and session management are handled by Amazon Cognito, which provides tokens for secured API calls. Backend: Developed in .NET (or a similar framework) and deployed on ECS Fargate. Handles business operations, user interactions, and service orchestration. Container images are stored in ECR and automatically deployed via GitLab CI/CD. Load balancing between backend containers is managed by ALB. AI Service: Developed in FastAPI, responsible for processing invoice images and voice inputs. Accesses raw data from S3, performs AI inference, and returns results to the Backend Service via internal APIs. Cloud Infrastructure: Runs inside a multi-AZ Amazon VPC, using Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution and CloudWatch for observability. Containers are stored in ECR and deployed through ECS Fargate. The deployment pipeline is automated using GitLab CI/CD. Security: User authentication managed by Amazon Cognito. Access permissions defined through IAM Roles for ECS, S3, CloudWatch, and API Gateway. Security Groups are tightly configured between ECS, ALB, and other services. AWS WAF provides web-layer protection against common exploits. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Pre-internship (Month 0): 1 month for planning. Internship (Month 1–4): Month 1: Learn AWS and upgrade programming skills. Month 2: Design and adjust architecture. Month 3-4: Implement, test, and deploy. Post-deployment: Research mobile development and deploy after month 5. 6. Budget Estimation You can review the detailed cost estimation by downloading the following files: 📊 CSV Pricing File 💾 JSON Pricing File\nService Monthly Cost AWS Fargate (ECS) $17.30 / month Application Load Balancer $18.98 / month Amazon API Gateway $2.50 / month Amazon Cognito $0.00 / month Amazon ECR $1.00 / month Amazon Route 53 $0.54 / month AWS WAF $7.20 / month Amazon CloudFront $2.00 / month AWS PrivateLink $10.49 / month Amazon S3 $0.34 / month Estimated Total ≈ $60.35 / month (≈ $724.21 / year) Note: The costs above are calculated based on AWS Pricing Calculator for the Asia Pacific (Singapore) region with assumptions for 100 monthly active users and basic resource requirements.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix\nAI model misrecognition (voice/bill): Medium impact, medium probability. AWS connection loss or regional service errors: High impact, low probability. Exceeding AWS usage budget: Medium impact, low probability. Data synchronization errors between microservices: Medium impact, medium probability. User information leakage (Cognito/Database): High impact, low probability. Mitigation Strategies\nAI: Improve OCR and voice-to-text models through additional training, regular testing with real data. AWS Region: Set up multi-AZ deployment and regular RDS database backup. Cost: Configure AWS Budget Alert and optimize ECS, S3 based on actual usage. Microservices: Use SQS/RabbitMQ to ensure asynchronous processing and retry on errors. Security: Data encryption (AES-256, HTTPS), IAM control following \u0026ldquo;Least Privilege\u0026rdquo; principle. Contingency Plans\nIf AWS encounters issues: Temporarily switch to local transaction data storage and sync after recovery. Restore infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation or pre-saved IaC (Infrastructure as Code). Keep regular database copies (RDS snapshots) for data loss recovery. 8. Expected results of the project Automated financial data entry: The application helps users avoid manual entry, just take a photo of the invoice or record a voice for the system to automatically classify spending. Intuitive financial management: Users can view spending charts, monthly reports, and receive savings suggestions based on consumer behavior. Minimal user experience: Friendly web interface, modern design, optimized for mobile devices and suitable for people new to financial management. Stable, scalable system: Microservices architecture makes it easy to add new features such as spending reminders, AI predictive analysis, or expand to a mobile app. Improving development team skills: Project members have practical access to DevOps processes, CI/CD implementation, and cloud-based application optimization. 9. Project limitations Vietnamese AI model is still limited: The ability to recognize regional voices or handwritten invoices has not yet achieved high accuracy. No separate mobile application: The MVP version only supports the web platform, there is no native mobile app. User limit: The current architecture is only optimized for 50–100 active users; when expanding the scale, the infrastructure needs to be restructured. Internet connection dependent: All processing and storage operations are via the cloud, cannot operate offline. Advanced security system has not been deployed: Only stops at Cognito authentication and basic encryption, no MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) or in-depth security logs. "

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services.

In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

	"content": "Week 5 Objectives: Learn foundational knowledge and core security services on AWS, centered around the \u0026ldquo;Security is job zero\u0026rdquo; philosophy. Start with the most basic concept: the Shared Responsibility Model. Focus deeply on managing identity and access (Identity and Access Management - IAM), including components: User, Group, Policy, and Role. Expand learning to identity management services at a larger scale, such as AWS Organizations (managing multiple accounts), AWS Identity Center (SSO) (single sign-on), and Amazon Cognito (user management for web/mobile apps). Gain solid knowledge of data protection through encryption with AWS KMS and monitoring/compliance checks with AWS Security Hub. Tasks to be carried out this week: Day Task Start Date Completion Date Reference Material 2 Shared Responsibility Model\n- Learn about the Shared Responsibility Model, in which AWS is responsible for security of the cloud (physical infrastructure, underlying software) and the customer is responsible for security in the cloud (configuration, data, applications).\n- Understand how security responsibilities change depending on the service type (infrastructure, combined management, or fully managed).\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\n- Learn about the Root Account, the account with absolute full permissions, and best practices to protect it (create an IAM Admin User for regular use, lock away root credentials).\n- Learn about IAM User, a principal used to interact with AWS, which has no permissions by default when created.\n- Understand the technique for efficient user management by grouping multiple IAM Users into an IAM Group.\n- Learn about IAM Policy, a JSON document that defines permissions, including 2 types:\n+ Identity-based Policy: Attached directly to an IAM Principal (User, Group, Role).\n+ Resource-based Policy: Attached directly to a resource (e.g., S3 Bucket Policy).\n- Understand the IAM permission evaluation technique, where an explicit deny always takes precedence, regardless of any other Allow policy.\n- Learn about the architecture of IAM Role, a set of permissions (policy) without permanent credentials (password/access key).\n- Understand the Assume Role technique: An IAM User (or Service) uses the AWS STS (Security Token Service) to temporarily \u0026ldquo;assume\u0026rdquo; the IAM Role\u0026rsquo;s permissions and receive temporary credentials.\n- Understand the practical application of IAM Role, e.g., granting an EC2 service permission to access S3 without storing access keys on the server. 06/10/2025 06/10/2025 Documentation: https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/\nYoutube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLahN4TLWtox2a3vElknwzU_urND8hLn1i\u0026si=W80Cdf_fSc6sjOV\nNotes: https://github.com/DazielNguyen/aws-fcj-report/blob/main/TAKE_NOTES_%26_LABS/Module_05/Take_notes_module_05.md 3 Amazon Cognito\n- Learn about Amazon Cognito, a service for managing authentication (login, sign-up) and authorization for end-users of web and mobile applications (different from IAM Users, who are AWS administrators).\n- Learn about the two main components of Cognito:\n+ User Pool: A user directory that manages users, supporting direct login or login via third-party providers (Facebook, Google).\n+ Identity Pool: Grants application users access (usually temporary) to other AWS services.\nAWS Organizations\n- Learn about AWS Organizations, a service that helps centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts.\n- Understand the Consolidated Billing technique for all accounts.\n- Understand the technique of grouping accounts into OUs (Organization Units) and applying Service Control Policies (SCP) to limit the maximum permissions that IAM Users/Roles in that account can perform (including deny-based).\nAWS Identity Center (SSO)\n- Learn about AWS Identity Center (SSO), a service that helps centrally manage access (single sign-on) to all AWS accounts in an Organization and to external applications.\n- Understand the technique of using Permission Sets (a set of permissions stored in Identity Center) to assign to Users/Groups.

	"content": "When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name. Leave other fields as default and click create Successfully create bucket\nNavigate to: Services \u0026gt; VPC \u0026gt; Endpoints, then select the Gateway VPC endpoint you created earlier. Click the Policy tab. Click Edit policy. The default policy allows access to all S3 Buckets through the VPC endpoint.\nIn Edit Policy console, copy \u0026amp; Paste the following policy, then replace yourbucketname-2 with your 2nd bucket name. This policy will allow access through the VPC endpoint to your new bucket, but not any other bucket in Amazon S3. Click Save to apply the policy. { \u0026#34;Id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Policy1631305502445\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stmt1631305501021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2/*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Successfully customize policy\nFrom your session on the Test-Gateway-Endpoint instance, test access to the S3 bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC aws s3 ls s3://\u0026lt;yourbucketname\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy:\nReturn to your home directory on your EC2 instance cd~ Create a file fallocate -l 1G test-bucket2.xyz Copy file to 2nd bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-2nd-bucket-name\u0026gt; This operation succeeds because it is permitted by the VPC endpoint policy.\nThen we test access to the first bucket by copy the file to 1st bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-1st-bucket-name\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy.\nPart 3 Summary: In this section, you created a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to test the policy. AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"

	"content": " Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:\nOverall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship? What do you think the company should improve for future interns? If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not? Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience? Would you like to continue this program in the future? Any other comments (free sharing): "
